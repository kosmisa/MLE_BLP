### Basic_MLE_HW

I am sorry due to very little time i had to spend on this HW i got confused and was unable to resolve the problems i had with homework in time. 

First problem i was unable to overcome in time is env setup. Somehow i keep getting errors on commands i want to call for pandas on VSC eventhought i am setting venv. separately from global.

Second problem is not spending enough time to work on problem, due to political nature in my country that is affecting both my work and university activities i found my self in situation that i have even less time to work on homework. I need to use iris data from sklearn but my template is focused on generating syntetic data and i failed to adapt that code to extract data
